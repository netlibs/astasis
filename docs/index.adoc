# Declarative Asterisk Graphs

Each AStG instance contains a graph which defines the current desired state of the asterisk instance.  AStG takes
this graph and attempts to apply it.

note that the AStG graph is a low level one which presents asterisk internals - higher level platform components take
application layer models and generate these graphs.

AStG deal in channels, bridges, and high level endpoints (RTFS endpoints, not SIP directly).  AStG converts these
endpoints to underlying asterisk ones as needed.

Having this lower level graph allows us to orchestrate logic across multiple AStG instances within a group.  For example, 
an agent with a channel on one AStG instance can connect to a caller on another by generating a graph for each instance
and then applying them, with a channel connecting the two together (e.g, over SIP).

This does not excuse constant multi-instance graphs - in general we try and keep channels on the same instance;  however there
are some legitimate scenarios where we have no choice but to work with channels which span instances.

If a channel can be REFERed w/Replaces, we can perform a complete offload by generating a graph on a new instance, bridging it in, 
and then generating a new channel on the replacement instance.
